# Summary - Fix

Good performance of TimescaleDB is important for several reasons, especially in the context of time-series data management:

1. **Efficient data ingestion**: Good performance ensures that the data can be ingested quickly and accurately, without delays or errors. This is particularly important in applications such as IoT, financial trading, monitoring, and analytics, where data streams are constantly generated and need to be processed in real-time.
2. **Fast queries and analytics**: Once the data is ingested into TimescaleDB, it needs to be queried and analyzed to extract insights and value. Good performance ensures that the queries can be executed efficiently and quickly, even on large datasets or complex queries. This is important for applications such as predictive maintenance, fraud detection, anomaly detection, and forecasting, where timely and accurate results can make a significant impact on the business or operations.
3. **High availability and scalability**: TimescaleDB is designed to be highly available and scalable, which means that it can handle multiple concurrent users and applications, and can withstand failures or outages without losing data or performance. Good performance ensures that the database can handle the workload and scale up or down as needed, without compromising on the performance or reliability.
4. **Lower costs and higher ROI**: Good performance of TimescaleDB can translate into lower costs and higher return on investment, as it can reduce the hardware requirements, the maintenance and support costs, and the development and deployment time. It can also enable new use cases and applications that require high-performance time-series data management, and can create new revenue streams or competitive advantages for the organization.
