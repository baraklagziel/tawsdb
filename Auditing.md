# Summary

TimescaleDB does not include built-in auditing features, but it can be integrated with various auditing and logging tools to track database activity and changes.tence summary of what this document is about and why we should work on it. 

# Goals

he goals of auditing are to provide a comprehensive, accurate, and verifiable record of all actions and events that occur in a system or process. The primary goals of auditing are:

1. **Security**: Auditing helps to identify and prevent unauthorized access, misuse, or manipulation of data or system resources. By tracking user activity and changes to the system, auditing can detect security breaches and help to prevent data loss, theft, or corruption.
2. **Compliance**: Auditing helps to ensure compliance with internal policies and external regulations, such as data protection laws, industry standards, or contractual obligations. By generating audit trails and reports, auditing can demonstrate that the system operates in a controlled and accountable manner, and that data privacy and security requirements are met.
3. **Accountability**: Auditing helps to establish accountability and responsibility for actions and events that occur in a system. By tracking user activity and changes, auditing can attribute specific actions to individual users or roles, and provide evidence of who did what and when.
4. **Quality assurance**: Auditing helps to ensure the quality and reliability of data and system processes. By tracking data modifications and system events, auditing can detect errors, inconsistencies, or anomalies that may affect the accuracy or integrity of the data, and help to improve the quality of the system and its outputs.

In summary, auditing is an essential practice for ensuring the security, compliance, accountability, and quality of a system or process, and helps to mitigate risks and prevent potential issues before they become critical problems.

# Proposed Solution

Here are some approaches you can take to implement auditing with TimescaleDB:

1. **Use PostgreSQL audit extensions**: TimescaleDB is built on top of PostgreSQL, and you can use PostgreSQL audit extensions such as pgAudit or pgaudit2 to track database activity and generate audit logs. These extensions provide detailed logging of database activity, including SQL statements, session information, and user actions.
2. **Use database triggers**: TimescaleDB supports PostgreSQL triggers, which can be used to execute custom code in response to database events. You can create triggers to log changes to specific tables or columns, or to enforce specific business rules or security policies.
3. **Use external logging and monitoring tools**: You can use external tools such as Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK stack), Splunk, or Grafana to monitor and analyze TimescaleDB logs and metrics. These tools can provide real-time visibility into database activity and help you identify and investigate potential security or compliance issues.
4. **Use third-party auditing solutions**: There are also third-party auditing solutions that can be integrated with TimescaleDB, such as Audit Trail or Idera SQL Compliance Manager. These tools provide more advanced auditing and compliance capabilities, including real-time monitoring, alerting, and reporting.

In summary, there are several ways to implement auditing with TimescaleDB, depending on your specific requirements and preferences. By using auditing and logging tools, you can track database activity and changes, identify potential security or compliance issues, and ensure the integrity and availability of your data.
