### How to Use StatefulSet for DB Cluster Management

When it comes to managing a database cluster, StatefulSet can be an incredibly useful tool. StatefulSet is a Kubernetes controller that enables stateful applications to be deployed and managed on a Kubernetes cluster.

In this article, we'll explore how to use StatefulSet for DB cluster management. We'll cover the basics of StatefulSet, its advantages for DB clusters, and provide step-by-step instructions on how to use StatefulSet for your own DB cluster.

What is StatefulSet?

StatefulSet is a Kubernetes controller that manages stateful applications, such as databases. It provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of pods in a cluster, which is critical for stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage.

StatefulSet also provides features like ordered rolling updates and scaling, which are essential for managing stateful applications without losing data or disrupting services.

Advantages of StatefulSet for DB Cluster Management

StatefulSet offers several advantages for managing DB clusters. Some of the key benefits include:

1. Stable Network Identities: StatefulSet assigns stable network identities to pods in a DB cluster, ensuring that they can be accessed reliably and consistently.
2. Persistent Storage: StatefulSet ensures that each pod in a DB cluster has its own persistent storage, which is essential for maintaining data consistency and availability.
3. Ordered Rolling Updates: StatefulSet can perform rolling updates of pods in a DB cluster in a specific order, ensuring that no data is lost during the update process.
4. Scaling: StatefulSet allows you to scale a DB cluster up or down, while preserving its unique network identities and persistent storage.

Using StatefulSet for DB Cluster Management

To use StatefulSet for DB cluster management, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up a Kubernetes Cluster

To begin, you need to set up a Kubernetes cluster. You can use a managed Kubernetes service like Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

Step 2: Define the StatefulSet

Once you have a Kubernetes cluster set up, you can define the StatefulSet for your DB cluster. This involves specifying the number of replicas, the persistent storage volume, and other configuration details.

Step 3: Create the StatefulSet

With the StatefulSet defined, you can now create it on your Kubernetes cluster. This will deploy the pods and configure the persistent storage volume for your DB cluster.

Step 4: Configure Your DB

After creating the StatefulSet, you need to configure your DB to work with it. This may involve setting up replication, configuring backups, or configuring other DB-specific settings.

Step 5: Monitor and Scale Your Cluster

Once your DB is configured, you can monitor and scale your cluster as needed. You can use Kubernetes' built-in monitoring tools to track your cluster's health and performance, and you can scale your cluster up or down using StatefulSet's scaling capabilities.

Conclusion

In conclusion, StatefulSet is an essential tool for managing DB clusters on Kubernetes. With its stable network identities, persistent storage, ordered rolling updates, and scaling capabilities, StatefulSet offers a powerful and reliable solution for DB cluster management.

By following the steps outlined in this article, you can use StatefulSet for your own DB cluster management needs. And with the support of Kubernetes' large and active community, you can be sure that you'll have plenty of resources and assistance along the way.

## Introduction

This directory contains a Helm chart to deploy a three node [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/) cluster in a High Availability (HA) configuration on Kubernetes. This chart will do the following:

- Creates three (by default) pods using a Kubernetes [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).
- Each pod has a container created using the [TimescaleDB Docker image](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-docker-ha).
    - TimescaleDB 2.1 and PG 13
- Each of the containers runs a TimescaleDB instance and [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) agent.
- Each TimescaleDB instance is configured for replication (1 Master + 2 Replicas).

When deploying on AWS EKS:

- The pods will be scheduled on nodes which run in different Availability Zones (AZs).
- An AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is configured to handle routing incoming traffic to the Master pod.

When configured for Backups to S3:

- Each pod will also include a container running [pgBackRest](https://pgbackrest.org/).
- By default, two [CronJobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/) are created to handle full weekly and incremental daily backups.
- The backups are stored to an S3 bucket.

### TimescaleDB Multinode

This directory contains a Helm chart to deploy a multinode [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb/) cluster. This chart will do the following:

- Creates a single TimescaleDB **Access Node** using a Kubernetes [StatefulSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/).
- Creates multiple pods (by default 3) containing **Data Nodes** using another Kubernetes StatefulSet
- Each pod has a container created using a Docker image which includes the TimescaleDB multinode sources
